# pig-dice-game

Pig is a simple dice game where (in this case) two players take turns rolling a die. As long as the active player doesn't roll a 1, the roll will be added to their "current" score (3 + 5 + 4, etc.).

If the active player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated on their current score and it becomes the other player's turn. 

Before rolling a 1, the active player has the option to "Hold" their current score. This will add their current score to the cumulative score from all of their successful turns, which is listed above. Once the player holds, it's the other player's turn.

First player to 100 cumulative points wins.

The game is pretty straightforward but erhaps I will add some Pig Game instructions to the CSS at a later date. Apparently Pig is a well known game, but I was not familiar with it.
